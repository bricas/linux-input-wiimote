0.4

  * Added support for the classic controller.

0.3.1

  * Switch to autoconf build (Noritada Kobayashi).

  * Fixed byte alignment issues, so the library now works on ARM
    systems (tested with GP2X and E680i).

0.3

  * Support for reading Mii data. See wiimote_mii.h for details (Chad 
    Phillips).

  * Support for multiple local devices. This feature automatically
    binds a wiimote to the local device with the least number of
    active connections (given priority to piconet masters when
    there is a tie). In theory, up to 112 (7 * HCI_MAX_DEV) wiimotes
    may be connected to a single host, but in practice the maximum
    number of wiimotes will be a lot less.

    By default wiimotes are automatically assigned to a device, but the
    assignment may be overriden by setting the wiimote->link.device to
    the desired device number (hci0 is device number 1).

    This feature is enabled by default, but may be turned off by compiling
    with _DISABLE_AUTO_SELECT_DEVICE which will enable the old behavior.

  * The wiimote_update() method no longer blocks until an event has
    been received from the wiimote. To enable the old behavior compile
    with _ENABLE_BLOCKING_UPDATE,

  * Added new method wiimote_pending() to check if there is any pending
    data from the wiimote.

0.2

  * Support for automatic discovery of wiimotes (Krishna Gadepalli,
    L. Donnie Smith).

  * Renamed the library to libcwiimote because of name conflict with another
    library (CWiid).

  * Changed tilt entry in wiimote to use floats instead of unsigned shorts
    (can be disabled by compiling without _ENABLE_TILT).

  * Added a new entry, force, in wiimote which holds the force on each axis
    in g (can be disabled by compiling without _ENABLE_FORCE). 

0.1

  * Initial release.
